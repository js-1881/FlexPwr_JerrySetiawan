Hello FlexPower team,

Readme:

For Task 1:
I uploaded two files (the database sqlite and the python file) inside the repository.

for Task 2:
The solution for task 2 can be downloaded here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JZHDLKVyxnJDvU_gQGx897HWUOHhB89L?usp=sharing).
I have included a readme sheet in the excel file for further details.
I answer each task in a separate sheet using Excel, except for Tasks 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.						
The answers/explanations/notes are located on the right side of the historical data table (highlighted cells).							  

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any other information.
Thank you.

Regards,
Jerry Setiawan
